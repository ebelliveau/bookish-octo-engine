# First rules of warfare

I wanted a list of the various instances of "The first rule of warfare is..." from [Isaac Arthur's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g), but lacked the time to watch ALL of the videos to derive them.  This script crawls his videos' subtitle data and retrieves all instances of "The first rule of warfare is...".

## Requirements:

* Python 3
* requests:  [https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/#](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/#)
* 

## Usage:

* Set your YouTube/GData API key in `models.py:24`
* `python warfare.py`

No drinks or snacks needed.  This runs through a mountain of data pretty quickly.
