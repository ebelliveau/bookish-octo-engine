# First rules of warfare

I wanted a list of the various instances of "The first rule of warfare is..." from [Isaac Arthur's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g), but lacked the time to watch ALL of the videos to derive them.  This script crawls his videos' subtitle data and retrieves all instances of "The first rule of warfare is...".

Stay tuned, fam.
